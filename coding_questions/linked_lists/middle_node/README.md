# Middle Node

You're given a Linked List with at least one node. Write a function that returns the middle node of the linked list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second one.

Each `LinkedListNode` has a `value` and a `next` pointer to the next node or to `null` / `None` if it is the last node.

## Sample input

```python
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

## Sample output
