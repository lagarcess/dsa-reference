# Remove Duplicates from Linked List

You're given a linked list, and your task is to remove all duplicate values from the list. The resulting linked list should contain only unique values. The linked list should be modified in place, meaning you should not create a new list/array to store the unique values.

## Sample Input and Output

```
linkedList: 1 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 4 ->5 -> 6 -> 6

Output: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
```

## Constraints

- The linked list may contain a large number of elements.
- The values in the linked list are sorted.
