# Level 1: Foundational Patterns (Arrays & Linked Lists)

## Two Pointers

**What it is:** Using two pointers to iterate through an array or list from different ends or at different speeds.

**When to use it:** When you need to compare elements from both ends of a data structure or when you want to find a pair of elements that meet a certain condition. e.g., iterate through sorted array or reduce complexity from $O(n2)$ to $O(n)$

**Mechanism**: initialize two pointers to track indices, move pointers away/towards each other based on conditions. Often requires a single pass.

**Example problems:** finding pairs that sum to a target, removing duplicates, squaring a sorted array.
