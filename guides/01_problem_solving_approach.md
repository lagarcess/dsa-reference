# Solving DSA Problems: A Step-by-Step Framework

This guide covers structured approaches to solving algorithmic problems.

The proposed framework consists of the following key steps:

1.  **Understand the Problem:** Before anything else, slow down and ensure you can explain the problem and its examples in your own words.
2.  **Check Constraints:** Analyze the given constraints (e.g., input size `n`) to determine the required time complexity, which will guide your choice of algorithm. For instance, an input of `n = 10^5` suggests a solution of `O(n log n)` or better is likely needed.
3.  **Identify Edge Cases:** Actively think about potential edge cases before coding. Consider scenarios like empty inputs, duplicates, negative numbers, or single-element inputs, etc.
4.  **Formulate a Brute Force Solution:** Start by mentally outlining or writing pseudocode for a simple, straightforward solution that works, even if it's inefficient. This provides a foundation to build upon.
5.  **Optimize the Solution:** Improve upon the brute force approach. Look for patterns, consider using more efficient data structures like hash maps, or apply algorithms like binary search to reduce time complexity.
6.  **Code, Test, and Refactor:** Write clean, readable code. Test it against the edge cases you identified earlier. Once it's working, review your code to see if it can be made cleaner or more efficient.
7.  **Practice Consistently:** Treat DSA as a skill that requires regular practice. The author recommends daily, focused sessions on learning concepts and solving a few problems, emphasizing quality over quantity.
